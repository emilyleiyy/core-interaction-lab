						<h3>Verifying your identity</h3>
						We’ll try to check your identity before Election Day, through the DMV number (driver’s license
						number or non-driver ID<br>
						number), or the last four digits of your social security number, which you’ll fill in below.
						<br>
						If you do not have a DMV or social security number, you may use a valid photo ID, a current
						utility
						bill, bank<br>
						statement, paycheck, government check or some other government document that shows your name and
						address. You may<br>
						include a copy of one of those types of ID when you mail this form.<br>
						If we are unable to verify your identity before Election Day, you will be asked for ID when you
						vote
						for the first time.<br>
